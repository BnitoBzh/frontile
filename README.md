Component Library for Ember Octane apps

**Under active development.**

## What is Frontile?

This project aims to provide the legos (components, helpers, modifiers, and styles) necessary for building consistent and powerful Ember.js apps while following best practices from the community and providing both low-level and high-level components for your application.

We believe that accessibility should be part of the core of any component library, and that's why all the components related to a11y are inside of the core package. We aim to provide the best accessible components by default as much as possible.

- Build as logically separated packages, so you can choose the pieces you're going to use.
- Written in TypeScript.
- All components are Glimmer components.
- Styles are just TailwindCSS plugins.
- Perfect for modern Ember.js apps like Ember Octane.
